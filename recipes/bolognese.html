            <p>
                This hearty dish uses meaty mushrooms and protein-rich lentils to beef up a completely plant-based dinner. Meat eaters won't even realize it's vegan!

                <li>Heat oil in Dutch oven on medium. Add onion, season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, 4 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high, add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep brown and beginning to stick, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium, stir in garlic and crushed pepper, and cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring until dark brown, 2 minutes. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits, then stir in lentils, tomatoes, 2 cups water, and bouillon. Bring to a boil, then simmer until lentils are tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Meanwhile, cook pasta per package directions. Serve bolognese over pasta, topped with parsley if desired.</li>
